# Kernowave

## Description

A responsive frontend app that calculates the quality of surf on beaches in Cornwall. A traffic light colour system is indicative of the surf quality and is calculated based on wind speed, coast orientation, swell size and wind direction.

## Technologies

The app uses next.js, react, styled-components and react-slick. The dynamic and restful next.js routing allows this app to be easily scalable when adding additional beaches from Magic Seaweed's API.

## Installation

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Future development

I am currently working on deploying the app using Electron and Heroku and using axios to mock api swell and wind conditions.
